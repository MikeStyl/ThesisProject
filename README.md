It can be compiled using "make". Removed compiled files use "make clean".
You can use the evaluator or the compiler depending on what you want to do. in order to use evaluator run "./evaluate (here the desired txt file or nothing if you want the input form standar in), same with compile but instead run "./commpile" instead of "./evaluate".

Note: This was compiled with ubuntu 22.04 and c++2a. It may not work if you try on lower ubuntu versions.
